## Installation
Enter the following command into the command line to install dependencies: ```npm i```

## Usage
This bot will require the user to have admin access on a Discord server in order to be added to the server. The user also requires their own bot token which is acquired from the Discord Developer Portal. A MongoDB Atlas connection is also necessary.

Once added to a server the bot can be started by running the following commands in the command line: ```npm run build``` , ```npm run start```.

Typing !help in the Discord server will show a list of commands available to the bot.
